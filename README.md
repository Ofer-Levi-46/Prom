## About This Project

This project is Jamie's and Ofer's PROM project. The main goal is to be able to provide signal-based communication between two devices using sound waves. It is a python-based application that utilizes the `sounddevice` library to capture and play sound, and `numpy` for numerical operations. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy expansion and integration of new features.

## Features

-   Feature 1: Encode and decode messages using sound waves.
-   Feature 2: Real time communication between devices.
